## Looking at statistics
Red Hat Mobile Application Platform provides metrics for both cloud and apps.  The statistics can be evaluated on a platform level as well as individual project level.

*sample data*

To view aggregated metrics, select **Analytics** in the studio's header.  For this workshop we have sample data to show; however, in a standard setup these metrics are captured and able to be displayed immediately.  These metrics provide you with the ability to see device installs, app startups, total cloud requests, and median active devices.  

Additionally you can do see these by a project level.
